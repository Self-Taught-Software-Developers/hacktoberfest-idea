# STSD Hacktober Fest 2021 Ideas

Hey everyone! This is a place to add any thoughts and ideas for the upcoming Hacktober Fest.

To add a thought, suggestion or anything you want to contribute, **please feel free to open an issue** (although it isn't actually one! lol). If you have a **project idea or suggestion**, mark it with the "*project idea*" tag. If you have a **tech related idea** (framework, language, etc.), please mark it with the "*tech idea*" tag.

If you have any questions, concerns or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out to either I or Fii!

Thank you for contributing and we look forward to hacking this October!
